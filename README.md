# Unsupervised particle sorting for cryo-EM using probabilistic PCA

This repository contains Matlab implementation of our paper "Unsupervised particle sorting for cryo-EM using probabilistic PCA"

# Requirements and Installation
We recommend the following dependencies.
- Matlab 2018b
- ASPIRE Matlab library (http://spr.math.princeton.edu/)

# Data
The experimental data sorting done in our paper is on the following dataset.
- EMPIAR-10028 Cryo-EM structure of the Plasmodium falciparum 80S ribosome (https://empiar.pdbj.org/entry/10028/)
- In 'data' folder we have a tagged subset of the above.
